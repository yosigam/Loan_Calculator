# Loan_Calculator
The Loan Amortization Schedule Calculator is a versatile tool designed to empower users to gain deeper insights into their loan details and future interest rates. By inputting key loan parameters such as principal amount, term in months, and current interest rate, users can generate a comprehensive amortization schedule that breaks down each payment into its principal and interest components. What sets this project apart is its capability to adapt to potential changes in interest rates, sourced from web scraping of reliable financial data. This feature is particularly relevant in Israel, where most loans are subject to fluctuating interest rates due to the Bank of Israel's adjustments to the formal Israeli bank rate. This project equips users with a forecast of future interest rates, enabling them to better understand and plan for fluctuations in their loan payments. Whether for personal financial planning or professional analysis, this project provides a valuable resource for individuals seeking clarity and control over their loan obligations.
